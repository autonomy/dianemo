## Multi-cloud Kubernetes

Running a large-scale Kubernetes cluster across multiple cloud providers or
forms of infrastructure can solve some important problems for your business,
but it can also create new ones. Different base OSes, different versions of
critical components, and different upgrade cycles can contribute to instability
and hard-to-troubleshoot problems.

Talos has been built from the ground up with multi-cloud operations teams in
mind, giving you a single platform that is compatible with multiple cloud
providers. In the future, you will be able to manage all of your Talos-based
environments from a single control plane.
