## Serverless Infrastructure

In a "serverless" environment where units of code are decomposed
down to the function level, demand may scale up and down rapidly as different
applications make different demands on the underlying infrastructure. Managing
the underlying infrastructure in an efficient and automated way is critical
to realize the benefits of running a serverless platform.

Due to its minimal footprint and design, Talos hosts can be scaled up and down
much faster than traditional OSes, which means your infrastructure can be more
responsive to changes in demand. Cluster management can be automated to make the
most efficient use of limited resources.
