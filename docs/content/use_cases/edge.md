## Edge Computing

Edge computing, where the data and compute power is distributed to different physical locations where it is needed, comes with many unique management challenges.
Applying system updates to traditional operating systems can be slow and use a lot of bandwidth, and losing remote access to an edge node because of a failed update can be catastrophic.

Talos makes computing at the edge safer and faster.
The minimal operating system requires less bandwidth to deploy and update, and the immutable Talos OS image ("no moving parts") makes updates easier to test, and more reliable upon deployment.
