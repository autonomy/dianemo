## osctl completion

Output shell completion code for the specified shell (bash or zsh)

### Synopsis

Output shell completion code for the specified shell (bash or zsh).
The shell code must be evaluated to provide interactive
completion of osctl commands.  This can be done by sourcing it from
the .bash_profile.

Note for zsh users: [1] zsh completions are only supported in versions of zsh >= 5.2

```
osctl completion SHELL [flags]

## If running Bash 3.2 included with macOS

		" >> $HOME/.bash_profile
