## osctl copy

Copy data out from the node

### Synopsis

Creates an .tar.gz archive at the node starting at <src-path> and
streams it back to the client.

If '-' is given for <local-path>, archive is written to stdout.
Otherwise archive is extracted to <local-path> which should be an empty directory or
osctl creates a directory if <local-path> doesn't exist. Command doesn't preserve
ownership and access mode for the files in extract mode, while  streamed .tar archive
captures ownership and permission bits.

```
osctl copy <src-path> -|<local-path> [flags]
```
