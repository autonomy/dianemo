[{"categories":null,"contents":" The osd service enforces a high level of security by utilizing mutual TLS for authentication and authorization. In this section we will configure mutual TLS by generating the certificates for the servers (osd) and clients (osctl).\nCluster Owners We recommend that the configuration of osd be performed by a cluster owner. A cluster owner should be a person of authority within an organization. Perhaps a director, manager, or senior member of a team. They are responsible for storing the root CA, and distributing the PKI for authorized cluster administrators.\nCluster Administrators The authorization to use osctl should be granted to a person fit for cluster administration. As a cluster administrator, the user gains access to the out-of-band management tools offered by Dianemo.\nConfiguring osd To configure osd, we will need:\n static IP addresses for each node that will participate as a master a root CA and identity certificates for each node participating as a master signed by the root CA  The following steps should be performed by a cluster owner.\nGenerating the Root CA The root CA can be generated by running:\nosctl gen ca --hours \u0026lt;hours\u0026gt; --organization \u0026lt;organization\u0026gt;  The cluster owner should store the generated private key (\u0026lt;organization\u0026gt;.key) in a safe place, that only other cluster owners have access to. The public certificate (\u0026lt;organization\u0026gt;.crt) should be made available to cluster administrators because, as we will see shortly, it is required to configure osctl.\nNote: The --rsa flag should not be specified for the generation of the osd CA.\n Generating the Identity Certificates Now that we have our root CA, we must create certificates that identify the node. As the cluster owner, run:\nosctl gen key --name \u0026lt;node-name\u0026gt; osctl gen csr --ip \u0026lt;node-ip\u0026gt; --key \u0026lt;node-name\u0026gt;.key osctl gen crt --hours \u0026lt;hours\u0026gt; --ca \u0026lt;organization\u0026gt; --csr \u0026lt;node-name\u0026gt;.csr --name \u0026lt;node-name\u0026gt;  Repeat this process for each node that will participate as a master.\nConfiguring osctl To configure osctl, we will need:\n the root CA we generated above and a certificate signed by the root CA specific to the user  The process for setting up osctl is done in part between a cluster owner and a user requesting to become a cluster administrator.\nGenerating the User Certificate The user requesting cluster administration access runs the following:\nosctl gen key --name \u0026lt;user\u0026gt; osctl gen csr --ip 127.0.0.1 --key \u0026lt;user\u0026gt;.key  Now, the cluster owner must generate a certificate from the above CSR. To do this, the user requesting access submits the CSR generated above to the cluster owner, and the cluster owner runs the following:\nosctl gen crt --hours \u0026lt;hours\u0026gt; --ca \u0026lt;organization\u0026gt; --csr \u0026lt;user\u0026gt;.csr --name \u0026lt;user\u0026gt;  The generated certificate is then sent to the requesting user using a secure channel.\nThe Configuration File With all the above steps done, the new cluster administrator can now create the configuration file for osctl.\ncat \u0026lt;organization\u0026gt;.crt | base64 cat \u0026lt;user\u0026gt;.crt | base64 cat \u0026lt;user\u0026gt;.key | base64  Now, create ~/.dianemo/config with the following contents:\ncontext: \u0026lt;context\u0026gt; contexts: \u0026lt;context\u0026gt;: target: \u0026lt;node-ip\u0026gt; ca: \u0026lt;base 64 encoded root public certificate\u0026gt; crt: \u0026lt;base 64 encoded user public certificate\u0026gt; key: \u0026lt;base 64 encoded user private key\u0026gt;  ","permalink":"https://dianemo.autonomy.io/configuration/osd/","tags":null,"title":"osd"},{"categories":null,"contents":"The kernel included with Dianemo is configured according to the recommendations outlined in the Kernel Self Protection Project (KSSP).\n","permalink":"https://dianemo.autonomy.io/components/kernel/","tags":null,"title":"kernel"},{"categories":null,"contents":" Configuring master nodes in a Dianemo Kubernetes cluster is a two part process:\n configuring the Dianemo specific options and configuring the Kubernetes specific options  To get started, create a YAML file we will use in the following steps:\ntouch \u0026lt;node-name\u0026gt;.yaml  Configuring Dianemo Injecting the Dianemo PKI Using osctl, and our output from the osd configuration documentation, inject the generated PKI into the configuration file:\nosctl inject os --crt \u0026lt;organization\u0026gt;.crt --key \u0026lt;organization\u0026gt;.key \u0026lt;node-name\u0026gt;.yaml osctl inject identity --crt \u0026lt;node-name\u0026gt;.crt --key \u0026lt;node-name\u0026gt;.key \u0026lt;node-name\u0026gt;.yaml  You should see the following fields populated:\nsecurity: os: ca: crt: \u0026lt;base 64 encoded root public certificate\u0026gt; key: \u0026lt;base 64 encoded root private key\u0026gt; identity: crt: \u0026lt;base 64 encoded identity public certificate\u0026gt; key: \u0026lt;base 64 encoded identity private key\u0026gt; ...

To run a Kubernetes cluster a certain level of trust is required to operate a cluster. For example, orchestrating the bootstrap of a highly available control plane requires the distribution of sensitive PKI data.\nTo that end, we created trustd. Based on the concept of a Root of Trust, trustd is a simple daemon responsible for establishing trust within the system. Once trust is established, various methods become available to the trustee. It can, for example, accept a write request from another node to place a file on disk.\nWe imagine that the number available methods will grow as Dianemo gets tested in the real world.\n","permalink":"https://dianemo.autonomy.io/components/trustd/","tags":null,"title":"trustd"},{"categories":null,"contents":"Highly available Kubernetes clusters are crucial for production quality clusters.

In an ideal world, the system would be self-healing and we would never have to touch it. But, in the real world, this does not happen. We still need a way to handle operational scenarios that may arise.\nThe osd daemon provides a way to do just that.
