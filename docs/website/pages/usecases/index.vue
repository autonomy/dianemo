        <div>
          <p>
            Edge computing, where the data and compute power is distributed to
            different physical locations where it is needed, comes with many
            unique management challenges. Applying system updates to traditional
            operating systems can be slow and use a lot of bandwidth, and losing
            remote access to an edge node because of a failed update can be
            catastrophic. Talos makes computing at the edge safer and faster.
            The minimal operating system requires less bandwidth to deploy and
            update, and the immutable Talos OS image ("no moving parts") makes
            updates easier to test, and more reliable upon deployment.

          <p>
            Running a large-scale Kubernetes cluster across multiple cloud
            providers or forms of infrastructure can solve some important
            problems for your business, but it can also create new ones.
            Different base OSes, different versions of critical components, and
            different upgrade cycles can contribute to instability and
            hard-to-troubleshoot problems. Talos has been built from the ground
            up with multi-cloud operations teams in mind, giving you a single
            platform that is compatible with multiple cloud providers. In the
            future, you will be able to manage all of your Talos-based
            environments from a single control plane.

        <h1>Serverless</h1>
        <div>
          <p>
            In a "serverless" environment where units of code are decomposed
            down to the function level, demand may scale up and down rapidly as
            different applications make different demands on the underlying
            infrastructure. Managing the underlying infrastructure in an
            efficient and automated way is critical to realize the benefits of
            running a serverless platform. Due to its minimal footprint and
            design, Talos hosts can be scaled up and down much faster than
            traditional OSes, which means your infrastructure can be more
            responsive to changes in demand. Cluster management can be automated
            to make the most efficient use of limited resources.
